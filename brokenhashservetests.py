Test 3: Check SHA512 to base64 is calculated properly using an outside source like https://approsto.com/sha-generator/

BUG: Job identifier takes 5 seconds to return
ISSUE: Hash changes if JSON key changes which would break logins if the key input changes
BUG: If an invalid request is made, it adds +1 to the Request count and brings down the average response time. 
     Perhaps those should be counted & response times for invalid requests calculated separately

3. If the JSON key of "password" changes, the hash changes, meaning the hash must be getting calculated from the JSON key plus the password. I wouldÂ suggest only calculating the hash from the password value in case in the off chance a future dev changed the JSON key to "pass" rather than "password".

Test 1: Try -1 and 0 as identifiers
Test 2: Try integer bigger than how many identifiers there are
Test 3: Try letters and special characters
Test 4: Verify valid requests always return base64 (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, +, /, =)
Test 5: Enter same password twice, verify same base64 hash is returned
'''


'''
Requirement 5: A GET to /stats should accept no data. It should return a JSON data structure
for the total hash requests since the server started and the average time of a hash
request in milliseconds.

curl http://127.0.0.1:8088/stats >
{"TotalRequests":3,"AverageTime":5004625}

Requirement 6: The software should be able to process multiple connections simultaneously.

Test 1: Test multiple simultaneous connections. 5, 20, 100, 1000 if possible

'''
Requirement 7: The software should support a graceful shutdown request. Meaning, it should allow any
in-flight password hashing to complete, reject any new requests, respond with a 200 and
shutdown.

Test 1: Try a simple shut down while no requests are in progress
Test 2: Test shutdown with 1 request pending
Test 3: Test shutdown with many requests pending
Test 4: Test all 3 requests after shut down
'''


'''
Requirement 8: No additional password requests should be allowed when shutdown is pending.

curl -X POST -d 'shutdown' http://127.0.0.1:8765/hash > 
200 Empty Response

Test 1: Try shutting down while no password requests are pending and request a password
Test 2: Repeat test 1 with multiple requests
Test 3: Submit multiple password requests, shutdown, and make password requests both before and after shut down is complete

BUG: Only 1 password after shutdown is rejected. More than one request appear to be processed and it appears that the password hasher could be
     kept open indefinitely if password requests continue
